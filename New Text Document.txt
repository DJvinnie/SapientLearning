note:

<!DOCTYPE html> --> first line

{
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"/>
}---> include in head tag.

all css files, third party javascript files go in HEAD tag.
project folder hierarchy:
assets(logo, images,audio,video) , scripts, styles(css files), vendor, index.html

all user defined javascript files should go in BODY

ordering of files, css or javascript, matters bcoz interpretor behaviour of browser.
indentation is important

structure of your code:
in body: navigation bar goes first, with end tag. insert header and footer tags. insert nav tag in header tag.
next, main body.(left, centre and right menu)
after main body, footer.


css, use class based styling not tag based styling.
3 modes to create classes: external file preferred.
selectors: tag, class, ID based.
99% of the time-->class based selector, always reusable.
ID based, only 1 element.
tag based, only for all tags.
